[ Revision 0.2 - 8 August 2021 - draft white paper - started by SMZ - continued by â€¦ the community ]

## ABSTRACT
Reading the specifications of the blockchain emerge the anomaly of the genesis block.
It couldn't just be what it appeared to be, one of the many blocks without a predecessor.
Hence the idea that the genesis block must really be the block it generates and not just the initial 
block of the blockchain.
If the genesis block isn't just a data block then the genesis block must be a code.
Only a code can truly generate and be called really genesis.
The concept idea that the genesis block must be a code changes the perspective.
The same code that manipulates the blockchain must be the genesis block.
